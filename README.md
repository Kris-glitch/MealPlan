This web application was my Harvard CS50 final project.

The idea behind the Meal Plan app is to provide a convenient tool for individuals who want to plan their meals in advance and avoid having to think about what to eat on a daily basis. The app allows users to input their own recipes and generate a meal plan for each day of the week, including options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The app also generates a shopping list based on the ingredients needed for the generated meal plan. Users have the ability to switch out meals if they do not like the generated options, and can view and edit their saved recipes in the "myrecipes" section of the app. Overall, the goal of the Meal Plan app is to make meal planning and grocery shopping more efficient and organized for its users.

I was using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Java Script, Python and Flask to do this project. The app.py serves as the core script, using Flask to handle web requests. It configures routes and functions for login, logout, registration, homepage, user recipes, recipe cards, and shopping lists.
